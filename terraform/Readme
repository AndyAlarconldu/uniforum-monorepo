# ☁️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

This directory contains the Terraform configuration used to provision the AWS infrastructure. It follows a **Modular Architecture** to support multiple environments (QA, Prod).

## 📂 Infrastructure Structure

The code is organized into reusable modules and environment-specific implementations:

### 🧩 Modules (`/modules`)
Independent resources that are called by the environments:

* **`network`**: VPC, Subnets (Public/Private), Internet Gateway, Route Tables.
* **`security`**: Security Groups (Firewall rules) for ALB, EC2, and databases.
* **`alb`**: Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
* **`api_gateway`**: Configuration for the Nginx entry point.
* **`asg_app`**: Auto Scaling Group for the application instances (EC2).
* **`bastion`**: Jump host for secure SSH access.
* **`rds_postgres`**: Managed Relational Database Service (PostgreSQL).
* **`redis`**: ElastiCache or self-managed Redis instance.

### 🌍 Environments (`/envs`)
State files and variable definitions for each deployment stage:

* **`dev` / `qa`**: Testing environments.
* **`prod`**: Production environment.

## 🚀 How to Deploy

1.  **Navigate to an environment:**
    ```bash
    cd terraform/envs/qa
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Preview Changes:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4.  **Apply Infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
