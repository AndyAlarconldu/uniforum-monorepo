# ⚙️ Backend Services - Microservices Ecosystem

This directory contains the source code for all the microservices that power the UNIFORUM platform.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The backend follows the **API Gateway Pattern**. All external requests are handled by **Nginx**, which acts as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate internal microservice.
