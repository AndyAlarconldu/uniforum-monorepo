# ❤️ Reaction Service

This microservice manages user reactions (Likes) in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technology
* **Framework:** Python (FastAPI)
* **Database:** **Redis** (In-Memory Key-Value Store)
* **Reasoning:** Redis provides sub-millisecond latency, making it ideal for counters like "Likes" that require high read/write speeds.

## 🔗 Endpoints
* `POST /reactions/{id}/like`: Increment like counter.
* `GET /reactions/{id}`: Get total likes for a post.
